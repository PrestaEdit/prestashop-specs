## Contributing to PrestaShop-specs

PrestaShop is an open source e-commerce solution. Everyone is welcome and even encouraged to contribute with their own improvements to the specifications.

**This repository is dedicated to the specifications of the PrestaShop project.**

Want to contribute to the source code of PrestaShop? Go to the [PrestaShop repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop).


## How to contribute

There are 3 types of contributions, and all types need your help. ;-)


### Improve existing specifications

When reading some specifications, if you notice improvements to be made, feel free to propose them! These improvements should only impact the way specifications are written and not the specifications and behaviors themselves.

Examples: you can fix typos, optimize the syntax, add visuals, more details, etc.


### Add missing specifications

We add and complete the specifications progressively, although a lot is missing for the moment. You can trust us, we are aware of it.

So you might want to write specifications for these existing features. Here, specifications are to defined the current behavior in the latest stable version of PrestaShop.

To do so, please use the template at the end of this page and read some examples before, you can look at this repository or the [templates folder](/spec-templates).


### Specify new features

Everytime we decide to build a new feature, we must write specifications to guide the developers through the feature's development - and thus through the feature's future improvements!


## Process to follow

We expect contributors to follow these instructions:

### If you want to edit directly into GitHub

**Edit a file directly in GitHub:**

1. Create your GitHub account, if you do not have one already.
2. Browse to the target file.
3. Click the "Edit" button, make your changes in the editor, then click on "Propose File Change". GitHub will automatically create a new fork and branch on your own GitHub account, then suggest to create a pull request to PrestaShop.
4. Once the pull request is submitted, just wait for a product manager to come back to you. :-)


### If you feel comfortable working with Git and forking the project

1. Create your GitHub account, if you do not have one already.
2. Fork the PrestaShop project to your Github account.
3. Clone your fork to your local machine.
4. Create a branch in your local clone for your changes.
5. Change the files in your branch. Make sure they meet our [coding standards](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/coding-standards).
6. Push the changed branch to your fork in your GitHub account.
7. Create a pull request for your changes on the PrestaShop project. If you need help to make a pull request, read the GitHub help page about [creating pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
8. Wait for one of the product managers to either include your change in the codebase or comment on possible adjustments to its content.


**Submit an issue using GitHub:**

This is a ticket-tracker for PrestaShop-specs, and the best place to write a suggestion or request an improvement. You will need to create a GitHub account.

That's it: you have contributed to this open source project! Congratulations!

Thank you for your help in making PrestaShop even better!


## Rules to follow when creating specs
### File Naming
Use dashes `-` for separators in images names and use lowercase.To help navigating through specifications please follow the structure:
`{{parent category}}-{{parent category}}-{{page name}}`
Example:
`catalog-products-add-edit.md`
`orders-orders-list.md`


This allows to easily spot where the page is located, especially as some pages have the same name but are located in different places, with a totally different purpose.

### tree organization
When submitting a PR, please locate the file in the corresponding folder. If you are not sure, don't worry, the product team will rewiew it.


### images naming
Use dashes `-` for separators in images names and use lowercase. Follow the pages structure. Indicate the feature name in the image.
Example: `orders-orders-list-quick-preview.png`


## What does it mean to be a contributor?
