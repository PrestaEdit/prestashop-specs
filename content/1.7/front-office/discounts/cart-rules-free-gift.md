# SPECIFICATIONS - FREE GIFT USAGE DURING CHECKOUT 


## Use the free gift cart rule

_As a customer, I want my free gift cart rule to be taken into account in my shopping cart._


When a merchant creates in the back office a cart rule with a 'free gift' option, it means that **only one item (of the product selected as a gift) is offered**. In the front office, customers can purchase additional quantity for this product but they should pay for _n-1_ items; customers can shop more of the free gift item, only the additional items will be charged.
