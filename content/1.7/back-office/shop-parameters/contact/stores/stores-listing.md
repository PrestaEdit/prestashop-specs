# Stores listing

This page lists all the stores. The stores enabled are displayed in the corresponding "stores" page of the front office.

## Multistore

Only the stores created in the selected store or store group (through the context) are displayed.

For example, let's say I have the following configuration:
- Group 1
  - Shop A
  - Shop B
- Group 2
  - Shop C

If I select group 1 as context, then the stores created in Shop A and Shop B will be displayed.

If I select Shop A as context, then the stores created in Shop A will be displayed.

If I select all shops as context, then the stores created in Shop A, Shop B and Shop C will be displayed.
