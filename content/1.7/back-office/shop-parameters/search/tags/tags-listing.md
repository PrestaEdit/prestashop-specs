# Tags listing

The tagging feature allows associating products with keywords. Customers can use the keywords to easily and quickly find the products they are looking for through the search bar in front office.

## Multistore

While creating or editing a tag, it's added or edited for all shops (no matter the context selected). So, the list displays all the tags, no matter the context selected.
