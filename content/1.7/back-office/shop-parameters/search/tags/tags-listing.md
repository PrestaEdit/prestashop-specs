# Tags listing

The tagging feature enables to associate products with keywords. Customers can use the keywords to easily and quickly find the products they are looking for.

## Multistore

Only the stores created in the selected store or store group (through the context) are displayed.

For example, let's say I have the following configuration:

  - Shop C

If I select group 1 as context, then the stores created in Shop A and Shop B will be displayed.

If I select Shop A as context, then the stores created in Shop A will be displayed.
