This UI lists the Prestashop Search Engines entries.

## Meaning of this page

Once the visitors are accessing the webshop, some of them come from Search Engines, like Google. Google Search Engine is added in the listing by default, after the Prestashop installation. The purpose of this page is to gather all the available Search Engines, that Prestashop can recognize. Then the shop administrators can manage those queries, and can be informed, where are the visitors coming from.
