 ## Call to action 
 There are 2 buttons at the bottom of this page: 
 - Cancel: The feature is not added and the listing is displayed
 - Save: The feature is added and a success message is displayed on the listing: "Successful creation."
 

When creating new feature shows a box of options that are:

 - Shops (allows to select which shop the feature will be created for, or all)
 - Option to checkmark certain shop or select all
 

On the right side:

 - Collapse all (Minimizes the shop list dropdown)
 - Expand all (Opens the dropdown for shop selection)
 - Check all (Check marks all of the shops)
 - Uncheck all (Unchecks all of the shops selected)
 
 
 If the checkbox selected to create the feature on all shops, will appear on all shops, if specific shop, only that shop will see the feature.
 
 
Different features are allocated for different shops, meaning that 2 different shops can have different features, or they can be created for all shops.

When selecting multishop, adding a new feature will open a new tab allowing to select which shop will have the created feature, a box with containing options should appear.
 
 
 # Editing an existing feature
 
 Pressing the dropdown menu at the right side prompts with an option to either edit or delete the feature.
 
 Editing the feature prompts with the same fields as creating a new one.
 
 All changes made will appear in the Attributes&Features -> Features list with a new ID.
 
 When changes are made, and saved, a message with a green backgroung saying "Successful update." should appear.
