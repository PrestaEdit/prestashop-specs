![Feature2](prestashop-specs/content/1.7/back-office/Feature2.png)


The button at the top right "Add a new feature" when pressed on redirects to a page where it's possible can create a new feature for the products.

When redirection happens the following field inputs should appear:

 - Name (name of the feature)
 - URL (when faceted module is enabled allows to search for the value more precisely, also can be in different languages)
 - Meta title (when faceted module is enabled allows to search for the value more precisely, also can be in different languages)
 - Indexable yes/no (allows or denies the use of the generated URL for faceted search)
 
 
## If store is Multishop 

When creating new feature shows a box of options that are:

 - Shops (allows to select which shop the feature will be created for, or all)
 - Option to checkmark certain shop or select all
 

On the right side:

 - Collapse all (Minimizes the shop list dropdown)
 - Expand all (Opens the dropdown for shop selection)
 - Check all (Check marks all of the shops)
 - Uncheck all (Unchecks all of the shops selected)
 
 
 If the checkbox selected to create the feature on all shops, will appear on all shops, if specific shop, only that shop will see the feature.
 
 
 # Editing an existing feature
 
 Pressing the dropdown menu at the right side prompts with an option to either edit or delete the feature.
 
 Editing the feature prompts with the same fields as creating a new one.
 
 All changes made will appear in the Attributes&Features -> Features list with a new ID.
 
 When changes are made, and saved, a message with a green backgroung saying "Seuccessful update." should appear.
