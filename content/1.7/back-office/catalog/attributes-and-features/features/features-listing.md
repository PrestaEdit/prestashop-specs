## HOW FEATURES WORK

![Feature](prestashop-specs/static/img/FeaturesFO.png)

Features must first be registered on the shop using this "Features" tab under the "Attributes & Features" page from the "Catalog" menu.

Then, they can be configured on a per-product basis, from the "Product" page under the "Catalog" menu, see [the specs of the add/edit product page](.../products/add-edit.md).

Once configured on a per-product basis, the features and values of the products are displayed on the front-office product page, in the "Product Details" tab.

### Bulk actions

Clicking on the _Bulk actions_ button allows users to perform bulk actions for selected features (using the checkboxes). A user can:

- Select all/Unselect all: this button will select/unselect all the checkboxes at the beginning of each row of the listing.
- Delete selected: This button will delete the selected features. 
After clicking on "Delete selected", a modal with the title "Delete selection" is opened asking to confirm or cancel the action: "Are you sure you want to delete the selected item(s)?" (See issue [#14462](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/14462)). The action can be canceled by clicking on the cross or on the cancel button.
After clicking on "Delete" button, the selected features and all their values are deleted, a successful message is displayed "The selection has been successfully deleted."

### Columns
The page displays the features list with the following columns:

1. ID

It's possible to sort by id asc or desc and search by id.

2. Name

It's possible to sort by name asc or desc and search by name.

3. Values

It indicates the number of values for each feature.

4. Position

The position of each feature can be changed by clicking on this column and by moving it up or down.
After changing the position, the message "Successful update." is displayed.

5. Actions

**View.** The values of the feature are displayed in a table. This is the main action and it can be performed by clicking on the line. When the feature has no value, the following message is displayed: "No records found"

**Edit.** The user can edit a feature as often as necessary.

**Delete.** A feature can be deleted by clicking this button. After clicking on Delete, a modal with the title "Delete selection" is opened asking to confirm or cancel the action: "Are you sure you want to delete the selected item(s)?"
The action can be canceled by clicking on the cross or on the cancel button.
After clicking on "Delete" button, the feature and all its values are deleted, a successful message is displayed "Successful deletion."

## Multistore

 Only the features created in the selected store or store group (through the context) are displayed.
For example, let's say there's the following configuration made:
- Group 1
  - Shop A
  - Shop B
- Group 2
  - Shop C
  
If the group 1 is selected as context, then the features created in Shop A and Shop B will be displayed.

If the Shop A is selected as context, then the features created in Shop A will be displayed.

If "all shops" is selected as context, then the features created in Shop A, Shop B, and Shop C will be displayed.
