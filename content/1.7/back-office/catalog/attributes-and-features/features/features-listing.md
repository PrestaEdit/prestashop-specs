## HOW FEATURES WORK

Features must first be registered on the shop using this "Features" tab under the "Attributes & Features" page from the "Catalog" menu.

Features are configured on a per-product basis, from the "Product" page under the "Catalog" menu, but they must first be registered on your shop using the tool on the "Features" tab under the "Attributes & Features" page from the "Catalog" menu.

Then, they can be configured on a per-product basis, from the "Product" page under the "Catalog" menu, see [the specs of the add/edit product page](.../products/add-edit.md).

Once configured on a per-product basis, the features and values of the products are displayed on the front-office product page, in the "Product Details" tab.
