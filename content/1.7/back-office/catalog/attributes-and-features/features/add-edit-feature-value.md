When pressing the button "Add new feature value" redirection to the "Feature value" window happens.

In there there's 4 input fields, 4 drop downs and 3 buttons.

First 4 fields:

 - Feature (mandatory drop down), when pressed on the drop down, shows the features available for selection.
 - Value (mandatory field), this field can be translated: When several languages are installed, a drop-down next to the field is displayed.
 - URL This field is displayed only when the facetedsearch module is enabled. It allows searching for the value more precisely. This field can be translated: When several     languages are installed, a drop-down next to the field is displayed. It allows choosing in which language the field is displayed and customizing it according to the language. Disabled languages are displayed in the drop-down. There is a help-text under this field: "When the Faceted Search module is enabled, you can get more detailed URLs by choosing the word that best represent this feature. By default, PrestaShop uses the feature's name, but you can change that setting using this field."
  - Meta title This field is displayed only when the facetedsearch module is enabled. It allows searching for the value more precisely. This field can be translated: When several languages are installed, a drop-down next to the field is displayed.

Below the 4 fields there are 3 more buttons (from left to right):

  - Cancel
  - Save then add another value (after saving, saves the added value, clears the fields to create a new one)
  - Save (Saves the value, redirect back to features menu with a message showing "Successful creation.")

If any of the mandatory fields are not entered/selected, the following message in a red background appears "The field value is required at least in English (English)."


For editing the feature values, everything is the same, just that the fields that are filled out stay when entering the editint window.


Features are configured on a per-product basis, from the "Product" page under the "Catalog" menu, but they must first be registered on your shop using the tool on the "Features" tab under the "Attributes & Features" page from the "Catalog" menu.

It's possible to set the features' order using the arrows in the "Position" column. The "Actions" column gives an Edit action, a Delete action and a View action which you can click to display the available values for this feature. From there, you can sort, edit and delete values if you need to.
