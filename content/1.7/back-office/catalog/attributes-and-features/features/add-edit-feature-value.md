Features are configured on a per-product basis, from the "Product" page under the "Catalog" menu, but they must first be registered on your shop using the tool on the "Features" tab under the "Attributes & Features" page from the "Catalog" menu.

You can set the features' order using the arrows in the "Position" column. The "Actions" column gives an Edit action, a Delete action and a View action which you can click to display the available values for this feature. From there, you can sort, edit and delete values if you need to.


 ## View feature - Composition (name of the feature, can be different)
 
 By viewing the feature, the name of the selected feature at the top should be seen.
 
 Inside there is the option to change the ID's of the values that the feature offers. Any of the fields can be deleted by bulk actions or selecting the field and deleting the selected.
 
 In the same page there are alse the buttons at the right:
 
  - Add new (for adding a new feature)
  - Refresh list (for updating the list)
  - Show SQL query (Opens a popup showing SQL code for the page)
  - Export to SQL Manager (redirects to the SQL manager in the back office)
 
 By pressing "edit" on a selected value, the following fields are prompted:
 
  - Feature (can be selected from different features that are created)
  - Value (edit the value of the feature)
  - URL (when faceted module is enabled allows to search for the value more precisely, also can be in different languages)
  - Meta title (when faceted module is enabled allows to search for the value more precisely, also can be in different languages)
  
After the changes are made either "save then add another value" or "save".


Different features are allocated for different shops, meaning that 2 different shops can have different features, or they can be created for all shops.

When selecting multishop, adding a new feature will open a new tab allowing to select which shop will have the created feature, a box with containing options should appear:
