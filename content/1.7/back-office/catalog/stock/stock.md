## Stock movement

**User story**

 As a merchant, I want to associate a stock edition with a movement type to track of the reason of a given physical stock movement.

  Stock movement | When the stock movement is saved | Impact
|:--------:| :-------------|:-------------|
Product return | When a user re-stocks a product from an Order that has been flagged as _shipped_ | The quantity re-stocked increases the product's physical stock | 
Employee edition | When the physical stock is edited without being linked to a customer order | The physical stock is increased or decreased
Customer Order | When an order has been flagged as _shipped_ | The physical stock is decreased from the reserved quantity
