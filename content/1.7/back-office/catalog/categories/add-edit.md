# SPECS CATEGORY PAGE

As a merchant I need to be able to correctly create, edit and delete my categories.

## SPECIFICATIONS

When I disable a category, I expect it to still be present in as a parent in the category tree _\(issue 14790\)_

When I add a category, all the customers groups should be selected by default, even the one created by the merchant  _\(issue 20691\)_
