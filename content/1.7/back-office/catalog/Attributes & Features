### Attributes and Features

## Attributes

Attributes are the basis of product variations (or "combinations" in PrestaShop's interface): you can only create variations of a product if at least one of its attributes changes. You should think of attributes as properties of a product that may change between variations while still keeping the same product name: color, capacity, size, weight, etc. You can use anything that varies between versions of the same product, except the price.

The difference between an attribute and a feature depends on the product itself. Some products might share the same property, one being an attribute built for building product variations, another one being simply an invariable feature. For instance, a customer can buy an iPad variation based on attributes (color, disk space) but not on features (weight, size).

Likewise, another shop might sell t-shirts variations based on attributes (color, size, gender) but not on features (weight). In your shop, features are displayed in a table, giving additional information about the product; while attributes make it possible to select among product combinations.

Attributes are configured on a per-product basis, from the "Products" page under the "Catalog" menu. However, they must first be registered on your shop using the tool on the "Attributes" tab of the "Attributes & Features" page, under the "Catalog" menu.

This page presents a list of all your currently registered attributes. You can edit or delete each one using the actions on the right of the table, or display their values by clicking on the "View" action, which opens a new table.
