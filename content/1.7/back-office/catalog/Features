# Features 

Features are configured on a per-product basis, from the "Product" page under the "Catalog" menu, but they must first be registered on your shop using the tool on the "Features" tab under the "Attributes & Features" page from the "Catalog" menu.

You can set the features' order using the arrows in the "Position" column. The "Actions" column gives an Edit action, a Delete action and a View action which you can click to display the available values for this feature. From there, you can sort, edit and delete values if you need to.

Each feature has it's own ID, Name, Value, and Position where it is placed in the list.

There is a search bar which has inputs of "ID", "Name", "Position" which will help to find a specific feature if there are a lot of them created.

Also there are buttons at the right hand which are:

 - Add new (for adding a new feature)
 - Refresh list (for updating the list)
 - Show SQL query (Opens a popup showing SQL code for the page)
 - Export to SQL Manager (redirects to the SQL manager in the back office)
 
 
 All of the features have a selecting field on the left, as well as bulk actions at the bottom left for selecting/unselecting all and deleting the selected fields.
 
 On the right side, for each feature you have the option to:
 
  - View (view the feature in details)
  - Edit (edit the feature)
  - Delete (delete the feature)
 
 
 ## View feature - Composition (name of the feature, can be different)
 
 By viewing the feature, you will see the name of the selected feature at the top.
 
 Inside you have the option to change the ID's of the values that the feature offers. Any of the fields can be deleted by bulk actions or selecting the field and deleting the selected.
 
 In the same page you also have the buttons at the right:
 
  - Add new (for adding a new feature)
  - Refresh list (for updating the list)
  - Show SQL query (Opens a popup showing SQL code for the page)
  - Export to SQL Manager (redirects to the SQL manager in the back office)
 
 By pressing "edit" on a selected value, you are prompted with changing the following:
 
  - Feature (can be selected from different features that are created)
  - Value (edit the value of the feature)
  - URL (when faceted module is enabled allows to search for the value more precisely, also can be in different languages)
  - Meta title (when faceted module is enabled allows to search for the value more precisely, also can be in different languages)
  
After making the needed changes you can either "save then add another value" or "save".

## Multilanguage

All of the fields within Features are translated to other selected language apart from the "Position" section.

 - Shops (Allows to select all the shops, or just 1 specific)
 - Collapse all (closes the options for possible shops)
