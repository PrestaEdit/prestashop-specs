The following elements of this page are:
- **Show All Modules dropdown** - once clicked, the dropdown element appears with the vertical list of all the modules installed in Prestashop. For faster searching capability, there is a search input field right at the top of module list. Typing first letters of the module name will throw search results and appropriate module.
- **Search for hook** - input text field, that is used for searching available hooks by naming them and writing the beginning of the name phrase. Once there are some letters typed in, the list instantly will respond to the required matching search results.
