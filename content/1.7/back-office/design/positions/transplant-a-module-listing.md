This functionality can be used for certain positioning of the certain module in different Prestashop UI places. Any Prestashop module can be registered on the placement operator called Hook. Thera are multiple different hook names in Prestashop, and module can be transplanted into the one of the desirable hooks.

There are different UI elements in the Positions > Transplant a module directory:

**Module** - text dropdown that sets the appropriate transplantable module name from the Prestashop gathered module list. By default, the dropdown is set as placeholder called "Please select a module".
