# Design > Image Settings > Add new Image setting

This configuration UI is about adding the new Image setting into the Image settings listing.

There are the following input text fields, that can be set:

- Name for the image type  - this is a required field, that describes the main name of the image type. The image type name should be used with underscores and hyphens only. Fore example, that could be _small_custom_, _large_, _custom-modified_small_.
