## Feature 1: Add to favorites 

### US 1: Add a product to a favorites list
##### As a logged-in user, I can add a product to my favorites from the product sheet or any other navigation page with product blocks in a favorites list
Several cases: 
- Connected users 
- Non logged-in users 
- Products with combinations & customizations

Functional rules: 
What type of users can add products to their favorites?  
Only logged-in users can add a product to their favourites - provided they click on the heart on the product sheet or a product block from a navigation page

![wishlist screen 1](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/img/wishlist-screen-1.png)


Which products can be added to favourites? 
All products can be added as favourites:  
- products in and out of stock  
- product packs
- virtual products
- customisable products (text or file)

What product information do I need to retrieve for favourites?
All product information:  
- Price excl. VAT or incl. VAT + special offers,  
- Photos,  
- Quantity (selected by the customer),  
- Variations,
- Customisation (if the product can be customised)

Product information (stocks, prices, etc.) is variable and must be updated each time the Favorites page is loaded.

Rules for quantities when adding to favorites :
- If the user has chosen a quantity > 1 the product added in favorites has the same quantity as the one on the product sheet
- By default, the product is added to the favourites by unit, unless the product can only be purchased with a minimum of X units, in which case, the product is added to the favourites with its minimum quantity
- If the product is out of stock: it is saved in favorites with the stock noted as 0

Products with variations:
- When a user adds a product from a list page (where they cannot select a variation), the product added to the wishlist is the "base" product. That is, the product is added with its default variation and quantity.  
- If the user selects a variation in the product sheet, then this variation is added, not the "basic" product

Customisable products
- If the user has selected the desired customisation before adding the item to their favorites, the product is will be added with the selected customisation
- If the user has not selected a customisation before adding the product to their favorites, the product is added to the wishlist without any type of customisation.  
- in both cases, they will not be able to add this product to the basket without going back to the product sheet (see US Add to basket)  

Logged-in user:  
For a logged-in user, when clicking on the heart, a pop-in is displayed offering them the option to add this product to:  
-	the default favourites list
-	one of the previously created lists (if the user does not have a previously created list, the default list is displayed - see below > the pop-up has a min. size),
![wishlist screen 2](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/img/wishlist-screen-2.png)

-	a new list that can be created by clicking Create New wishlist
![wishlist screen 3](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/img/wishlist-screen-3.png)

The user can only select one list at a time.  

What happens in each case?
1.	When no list has been created: the logged-in user has the option to add the item(s) to the default list or create a new list  
2.	When at least one list has been created: the logged-in user has the option to add the item(s) to the default favourites list, their existing lists or a new list.
3.	When more than X lists have been created: the logged-in user can scroll down to see all the lists created.

A maximum of 100 lists is allowed.

The heart is filled in once the product is added to a favourites list  

Favourites heart for variations: in the list pages, the heart will not be filled in if the default variation is not selected
![wishlist screen 4](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/img/wishlist-screen-4.png)

If the user clicks on the filled-in heart again, the product is removed from the wishlist. If the product is deleted the seller, it should no longer appear in the users' favourites lists.

For a non-logged-in user:
For a non-logged-in user: when they click on the heart, a login pop-up opens informing them that they need to be logged in to add a product to their favourites:
![wishlist screen 5](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/img/wishlist-screen-5.png)


When clicking on "Sign in", the user is redirected to the login page. Once the connection is made, the user is directly redirected to the page they were on.

Special login pop-up features:
-	add a go-back setting to the URL so that, once the user is logged in, they are redirected to the page they were on (any page)
-	the user is then asked to select the favourites list in which he/she wants to save the product.

### US 2: View my favourite products

Please note that if a product is deleted or deactivated from the catalogue, the product automatically disappears from the list.  

For each product, you have to go back to the information listed in US nÂ°1.
As a logged-in user, I can see how many unique favourite products are in a list.  

What type of users can add products to their favourites?
Only logged-in users, since the Favourites list is displayed in My Account.  

When I access the page with the my favourites lists, I can see the number of products in each of the lists.  

### US 3: Edit and/or delete a favorite product
##### As a logged-in user, I can edit and/or delete a favourite product  
Different cases:
- Products in stock
- Products out of stock
- from the product sheet
- from a favourites list

Functional rules:
I can modify the quantity, the variations and the customisation of all my favourite products (in stock, out of stock) by clicking on the Pencil in my favourite products list.

When I click on the Pencil, I am redirected to the product sheet to make my modifications. Once the changes are made, you will have to click on the heart to add the new product as a favourite. At this point, the new quantity, variation and/or customisation will overwrite the original product in the favourites list.

![wishlist screen 10](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/img/wishlist-screen-10.png)

I can permanently remove a favourite product from the list by clicking on remove and a pop-up appears confirming that the product has been removed from the list.  

You can remove a product from the favourites directly within the product sheet or a product listing, by clicking on the heart (which becomes empty).  

Products with several options:
- if I delete my product from the product sheet: the product with variations X and quantity Y will be deleted
- if I delete my product from a product listing (where I don't have any variation options), it deletes the product with the defaultvariation  

### US 4: Add a favourite product to the basket  
##### As a logged-in user, I can add a favourite product to the shopping basket

Specific case:
-	custom product that cannot be added directly to the basket from the list of favourite products

Functional rules:
A logged-in user can add one of their favourites to the basket, except custom products (with stock or without stock but with the possibility to be added to the cart), by clicking on Add to cart.
![wishlist screen 11](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/img/wishlist-screen-11.png)

If the product is Out of stock and cannot be added to the basket: 
-	a message is displayed informing the user that the product is no longer available: "Product out of stock".
-	the "Add to basket" CTA is greyed out and the product cannot be added to the basket

![wishlist screen 12](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/img/wishlist-screen-12.png)

If different variations are available for the same product: 
-	a message tells the user that the product is available in other options "Product available with different options"
-	the product image and the Add to basket CTA are greyed out 

![wishlist screen 13](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/img/wishlist-screen-13.png)

For a custom product :
If it is a custom product, the user will not be able to add this product to the basket directly from the favourites list. The "Add to basket" CTA is replaced by "Customise". 

When clicking on the CTA, the user is redirected to the product sheet in order to customise the product, and if it is already filled in, they can add this product as a favourite. 

![wishlist screen 14](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/blob/master/img/wishlist-screen-14.png)

Only non-custom products, with stock or without stock - but with the option to add to the basket, can be added to the basket. If the product is out of stock and has been set up to not receive out-of-stock orders, the user will not be able to add it to the shopping basket, as is currently the case in the PrestaShop Core.
