## Cart Rule 

**when 2 vouchers applied to a cart have free shipping.**

2 vouchers should be applied but the shipping should be deducted once. 

If I applied 2 vouchers in a cart:
- Voucher 1: Free Shipping + 5%
- Voucher 2: Free Shipping + Gift

Then 

Free shipping is applied once with a 5 % discount and a gift.

**When a voucher discounting the cheapest product** display the value of the discount and not the percentage.
