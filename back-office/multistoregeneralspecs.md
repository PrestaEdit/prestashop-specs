# SPECS GENERAL MULTISTORE BACK-OFFICE

As a merchant I need to be able to correctly manage all my stores

## WHAT

Thus, this project aims at specifying the current and expected behaviour when the multistore is enabled and when there are several stores. It's the general behavior. Some pages can have specific behaviors, you can find these specific cases in back-office/multistorespecialsspecs.md

## SPECIFICATIONS

### Shop & shop group color

From 1.7.8, while creating a shop or a group, the user can select a color as described in the specs to setup the multistore feature located  in back-office/advanced-parameters/multistore/multistore.md<br/>
This color will be displayed in the multistore header for the selected shop or shop group.<br/>
It will be also displayed before the name of each shop / group in the context drop-down.

### Multistore header (only from 1.7.8)
DESIGN:https://invis.io/QPWKQY5DV79#/410364467_All_Shops_0

On each page, when the multistore feature is enabled and if many shops are created, a multistore header is displayed.<br/>
The multistore header contains many things listed below:

**Color (only from 1.7.8)**
DESIGN: https://invis.io/QPWKQY5DV79#/412654655_Contexte_Candy

This header takes the color of the selected context:<br/>
- The all shops context is blue #25B9D8 and this color can't be changed by the user.<br/>
- The shop group color can be configured while creating or editing the group<br/>
- The shop color can be configured while creating or editing the shop.

If the shop or the group selected doesn't have yet a color configured, the default color is light grey #EBEBEB.<br/>
In this case, an information message is displayed on the page to prompt the user to define a color with a link opening the store's or group's page edition: "Customize your multistore header, follow the link to pick a color for this shop context" in Admin.Navigation.Header<br/>
The user can close the information message. The message is closed only for the selected context and it will not be redisplayed if the user refreshes or returns to this page later.

**Name of the selected context**

The name of the selected context is displayed, it can be:
- All shops
- A shop group name
- A shop name

**View my shop link**

When a shop is selected, a link "view my shop" is displayed and opens the front-office of the shop.

**Context drop-down**
DESIGN:https://invis.io/QPWKQY5DV79#/410364468_All_Shops_Dropdown

In the multistore header, there is a context drop-down allowing to select the context.

In the drop-down there is a search bar with auto-completion allowing to search and select a shop or a group quickly.<br/>
There is a placeholder: "Search shop name"<br/>
As soon as a user types a character in the field, a search is immediately performed and returned.<br/>
The results are displayed in a frame below the search field. <br/>
The displayed results can then be browsed, either by the arrow keys on the keyboard, or by the mouse cursor.<br/>
If the user chooses one of the listed results, it is automatically written in the search field and selected as context.

The options listed in this drop-down are:
- All shops with a link to select it as context
- The shop groups names with a link to select the group as context
- The shop names with a link to select the shop as context

The colors of each shop and group are displayed before each option.<br/>
When the user hovers the color, a tooltip is displayed "edit color"<br/>
The user can click on the color to change it<br/>
It opens the store's or group's page edition.
The selected context as a check icon in front of the name. On hover, the check is replaced by the color with the tooltip. 

If the shop URL is configured, a "view my shop" link is displayed after each shop name.<br/>
It opens the front-office of the corresponding shop.

If the shop URL isn't configured, a "configure shop URL" link is displayed after each shop name.<br/>
It opens the store's page edition.

**Behavior when switching context**
DESIGN:https://invis.io/QPWKQY5DV79#/420155466_Poppin_Context_Switch

If the user tries to change context without having saved, a modal appears: "You are about to switch context. Do you want to save your modifications before?" with 2 CTA: "Save" and "Cancel"
If the user clicks on "Save", then modifications are saved and the context is changed for the one selected
If the user clicks on "Cancel", then modifications are not saved and the context is changed for the one selected

### Shop association block

The shop association block is displayed when you add or edit something.<br/>
The shop association block displays all groups and all shops.<br/>
Checkboxes allow to select / unselect groups and shops.<br/>
It's possible to expand / collapse the wall tree and expand / collapse each group<br/>
If you select / unselect a group, all shops of this group are selected / unselected

The shop association block allows to choose for which store(s) you want to associate or disassocate the current element.

When you add something, the shop(s) selected in the context are automatically checked in the shop association block.<br/>
But it's possible to select / uncelect shops, no matter the context selected.

When you edit something, you can unselect shop(s) previously selected and therefore disassocate it from these shops.<br/>
And you can also, select shop(s) not previously selected and therefore associate it with these shops.<br/>
If the merchant unselect all the checkboxes (all the shops), then an error message in red is displayed below the shop association block to inform of the obligation to have at least one shop checked: "You have to select at least one shop to associate this item with" + the save button is disabled. **only from 1.7.8**

### Actions in the lisitngs (grids)

**Delete action**

If an element (category, attribute, feature ...) is associated with several shops, then if I delete it from the listing, it will be disassociated for the selected context(s) and deleted if the all shops context is selected. 

**Enable/disable**

If an element (category, attribute, feature ...) is associated with several shops, then if I enable or disable it from the listing, the action will be done for the store(s) with which the item is associated and not only for the selected context. 
When the user hovers the enable/disable icon, a tooltip is displayed "It will apply to all stores associated with this item" (**from 1.7.8**)

**Position column (from 1.7.8)**
If the listing has a position column, then it should be displayed only in a specific shop context.
Changing the position of a block is possible only in a specific shop context.


### Checkboxes
DESIGN: https://invis.io/QPWKQY5DV79#/410364470_Contexte_1_Yes

Checkboxes are displayed in a specific shop context and in a group context <br/>
They are not displayed in all shops context <br/>
They are displayed before each fields / toggles / parameters unless if an exception is defined in the specs of the page<br/>
When checkboxes are not selected, the fields or toggles are disabled.

Checkboxes allow:
- to select one or many fields / toggles
- to enabled selected fields / toggles
- to apply a different configuration for the selected store or group
- to submit only the selected fields / toggles
- the merchant to see which parameters have different value(s) for the selected store or group

An information message is displayed on all pages where there are checkboxes, to indicate what they are used for.<br/>
The user can close the information message. The message is closed only for the selected context and it will not be redisplayed if the user refresh or return on this page later.<br/>
"If you want to apply specific settings to a store or a group of shops, you need to select the parameter to modify, bring your modifications and then save."
