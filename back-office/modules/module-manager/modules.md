## Modules header

Upload a module. [TO BE COMPLETED]

If the module zip file is too big, the upload fails and the modal window notices the error:

![Module upload failed](/img/Module-upload-failed-modal.png)

Clicking on 'What happened?' should display `Your uploaded file might exceed the upload_max_filesize and the post_max_size directives in php.ini, please check your server configuration.` in `Admin.Notifications.Error`, cf. _to do_ #[16428](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/16428) issue.
