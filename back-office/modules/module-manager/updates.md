# **SPECIFICATIONS - MODULE MANAGER > UPDATES PAGE**


_As a merchant, I want to be able to get the list of all the modules I need to update._

## Modules listing

[TO BE COMPLETED]

Among many actions, merchants can upgrade modules by clicking the CTA at the right end of each module line. A modal window should be displayed to warn users about the potential risk of doing an upgrade on production without a test. Here are the two identified cases:

1. the user is **already on maintenance mode**:

_Are you sure you want to upgrade this module?_

If yes, he/she should click _Upgrade_.</br>
If no, he/she should click _Cancel_.

2. the user is **not on maintenance mode**:

_Are you sure you want to upgrade this module? We strongly advise you to upgrade the modules on maintenance mode to avoid any cache issues._

If he/she wants to proceed, he/she should click _Upgrade anyway_.</br>
If he/she wants to enable the maintenance mode, he/she should click _Go to maintenance page_.</br>
If no, he/she should click _Cancel_.
