# SPECS BREADCRUMBS FRONT-OFFICE

## DESIGN RULES
- Replace “/” by “>” in order to show more continuity with a path
- Bold will be used as the weight of the current page and won’t be clickable
- Previous levels will be underline on hover to show that it’s clickable
- Breadcrumbs only appears when there’s at least 3 levels
- No breadcrumbs in the cart because as it is the beginning of the purchase funnel, there needs to be a little “distraction” as possible, and there is already a link to go back to the storefront
- No breadcrumbs in Notfound page, it’s a common practice to not let breadcrumbs on this page

## POSITION AND PLACEMENT RULES
- Keep the same position
