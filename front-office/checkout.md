# **SPECIFICATIONS - CHECKOUT**


[TO BE COMPLETED]

## Payment step

If the store has only one payment method available, this payment method should be selected by default.


## Shipping step

If the merchant has enabled the 'Offer recycled packaging' option in the Shop Parameters > Order Settings section of the back office, the visitor/customer should see it mentioned at the shipping step of the checkout: `Recycled packaging` (localized in `Shop.Theme.Checkout`) must be displayed in the _Shipping Method_ block. Cf. _to do_ #[16348](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/16348) issue.


## Order confirmation

If the merchant has enabled the 'Offer recycled packaging' option in the Shop Parameters > Order Settings section of the back office, the visitor/customer should see it mentioned on the order confirmation page in the front office. `Recycled packaging` (localized in `Shop.Theme.Checkout`) must be displayed in the _Order Details_ section, just below the shipping method line. Cf. _to do_ #[16348](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/16348) issue.
