USER STORY As a merchant, I want to manage the display of my currencies in the Front Office depending on the language if needed in order to adapt my shop to my clients&#39; visual expectations.
WHY We have understood there is a big complexity on the currency display choose when you shop is for B2C or B2B, or when you sell in countries sharing the same symbol currency as in Latin America countries with the pesos.</description>

      <description>SPECIFICATIONS - INTERNATIONAL &amp;gt; LOCALIZATION &amp;gt; LOCALIZATION As a merchant, I need to be able to manage my localizations to handle the importation packages, the language and the currency configuration of the Front-Office, the local units used by the shop.
WHAT In this page, we aim at describing the current and expected behaviors when we add, edit, or delete localizations.
WHY As a merchant, being able to manage localizations will help to have my own units, languages, and currencies for each country separately or adding and/or modifying my own states and zones for each country as well.</description>
